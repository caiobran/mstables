msTables was a [MorningStar.com](https://www.morningstar.com) scraper written in python that fetches, parses and stores financial and market data for over 70k securities into a relational SQLite database. The scraper provided a Command Line Interface (CLI) that allows the user greater flexibility for creating and managing multiple *.sqlite* files. Once data has been downloaded into the database files, [dataframes.py](dataframes.py) module can be used to easily create DataFrame objects from the database tables for further analysis.

The scraper had to change starting in 2016 and finally in 2017 Morningstar paywalled access to MsRatio data see [Morningstar API](https://www.morningstar.com/content/dam/marketing/shared/Company/Products/Direct_Cloud/Morningstar-Cloud-Technical-FAQ.pdf). We are expanding upon the work that caiobran did for us to include multiple API's, pandas datareader, and local financial analysis for multiple functions. See [input/api.json](input/api.json) for the complete list of URL's.

## Motivation
As a fan of [Benjamin Graham](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benjamin_Graham)'s [value investing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_investing), I have always searched for sources of consolidated financial data that would allow me to identify 'undervalued' companies from a large pool of global public stocks. However, most *(if not all)* financial services that provide such data consolidation are not free and, as a small retail investor, I was not willing to pay for their fees. In fact, most of the data I needed was already available for free on various financial website, just not in a consolidated format. Therefore, I decided to create a web scraper for [MorningStar.com](https://www.morningstar.com), which is the website that I found to have the most available data in a more standardized and structured format. MS was also one of the only website services that published free financial performance data for the past 10 yrs, while most sites only provided free data for last 5 yrs.

## Next steps
- Finalize instructions for the scraper CLI

Instructions
------------

### Program Requirements
The scraper should run on any Linux distribution that has Python3 and the following modules installed:

- [Beautiful Soup](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/)
- [requests](http://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/)
- [sqlite3](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sqlite3.html)
- [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)
- [numpy](http://www.numpy.org/)
- [multiprocessing](https://docs.python.org/3/library/multiprocessing.html?highlight=multiprocessing#module-multiprocessing)

To view the [notebook with data visualization examples][1] mentioned in the instructions below, you must also have [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) and [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) installed.

### Installation
Open a Linux terminal in the desired installation directory and execute `git clone https://github.com/caiobran/msTables.git` to download the project files.

### Using the scraper Command Line Interface (CLI)

Execute `python main.py` from the project root directory to start the scraper CLI. If the program has started correctly, you should see the following interface:

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/D1Y25LN.png" alt="" width="600"/>

1. If you are running the scraper for the first time, enter option `1` to create the initial SQLite database tables.
2. Once that action has been completed, and on subsequent runs, enter option `2` to download the latest data from the MorningStar [URL's](input/api.json).
    - You will be prompted to enter the number of records you would like to update. You can enter a large number such as `1000000` if you would like the scraper to update all records. You may also enter smaller quantities if you do not want the scraper to run for a long period of time.
    - On average, it has taken about three days to update all records with the current program parameters and an Internet speed > 100mbps. The program can be interrupted at any time using <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>C</kbd>.
    - One may want to increase the size of the multiprocessing pool in [main.py](main.py) that is used for URL requests to speed up the scraper. *However, I do not recommend doing that as the MorningStar servers will not be too happy about receiving many simultaneous GET requests from the same IP address.*

*(documentation in progress, to be updated with instructions on remaining actions)*

### How to access the SQLite database tables using module _dataframes.py_
The scraper will automatically create a directory *db/* in the root folder to store the *.sqlite* database files generated. The current file name in use will be displayed on the scraper CLI under action `0` (see CLI figure above). Database files will contain a relational database with the following main tables:

**Database Tables**
- all _**MS*** tables and ratio data has been paywalled so we are side stepping those. The below financial info needs to be adjusted to allow for analysis from other data sources. See pandas dataframe for full list.
- _**Master**_: Main bridge table with complete list of security and exchange symbol pairs, security name, sector, industry, security type, and FY end dates
- _**MSheader**_: Quote Summary data with day hi, day lo, 52wk hi, 52wk lo, forward P/E, div. yield, volumes, and current P/B, P/S, and P/CF ratios
- _**MSvaluation**_: 10yr stock valuation indicators (P/E, P/S, P/B, P/C)
- _**MSfinancials**_: Key performance ratios for past 10 yrs
- _**MSratio_cashflow**_, _**MSratio_financial**_, _**MSratio_growth**_, _**MSratio_profitability**_, _**MSratio_efficiency**_: Financial performance ratios for past 10 yrs
- _**MSreport_is_yr**_, _**MSreport_is_qt**_: Income Statements for past 5 yrs and 5 qtrs, respectively
- _**MSreport_bs_yr**_, _**MSreport_bs_qt**_: Balance Sheets for past 5 yrs and 5 qtrs, respectively
- _**MSreport_cf_yr**_, _**MSreport_cf_qt**_: Cash Flow Statements for past 5 yrs and 5 qtrs, respectively
- _**MSpricehistory**_: Current 50, 100 and 200 day price averages and 10 year price history (price history is compressed)
- _**InsiderTransactions**_: Insider transactions for the past year from [http://insiders.morningstar.com](http://insiders.morningstar.com) (+600k transactions)

**How to slice and dice the data using dataframes.py**

Module _dataframes_ contains a class that can be used to generate pandas DataFrames for the data in the SQLite database file that is generated by the web crawler.
